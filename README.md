# Gobbler

![](https://i.imgur.com/TFHFCPs.png)

* Hear what people are **talking** about, Gobble it up, and best but not least **EDIT your Gobbles!**
* I know what you're thinking what makes our app special? We give you a feature that twitter can't give you, which includes being able to edit your own Gobbles you put out on your feed.


## Technologies used:
* HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* [Twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit)
* Passport.js
* Twitter API
* Node.js
* Bootstrap
* Materialize
* Express
* Mongoose
* MongoDB
* Heroku

## RESTful API Endpoints
| Endpoint          | Purpose                  |
| -------------     |:-------------:           |
| /api/gobbles      | returns all gobbles      |
| /api/users        | returns all users        |
| /api/gobbles/:id  | returns a single gobble  |

## Unsolved Problems 
* Getting oauth tokens from login / multi-user oauth
* Making and preserving likes
* Twitter/Gobbler action integration


## Future Enhancements
* Being able to Regobble and Retweet a Gobble.
* Search twitter users.
* Socket.io
* Aquire higher rate limit
